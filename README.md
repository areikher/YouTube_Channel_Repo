# YouTube_Channel_Repo
This Repo is for my YouTube Channel Repo. This project explores the use of machine learning to predict YouTube video performance metrics—such as likes, dislikes, views, and other engagement measures—based solely on the video title. The repository contains the full dataset and code used to train and evaluate the model, as well as a simple chat-based interface for generating predictions.

The YouTube channel used for this project is still in its early stages, with fewer than 100 Shorts published over the past year. While high accuracy is not expected at this point, the project serves as a proof of concept. The model is designed to improve over time as more videos are uploaded and the dataset is updated, allowing for increasingly accurate performance forecasts.
